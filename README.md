Subject: Weekly Update: May 5 – May 10

Dear [Manager’s Name],

I hope you’re doing well.

Please find below my weekly update for the period May 5 – May 10:

⸻

This week I focused on hands-on activities, in-depth review of the MyCreditApp modules, UAT platform testing, and backend practice for better understanding of system flow and data operations.

1. MyCreditApp Functional Exploration:
	•	Reviewed the Workflow module using official documentation, learning resources, and flash tutorials to understand request processing and user interaction flow.
	•	Explored supporting sections like Credit App Academy, FAQs, SuperUsers, and SharePoint to improve familiarity with available tools and onboarding content.
	•	Understood how different user roles interact within the system and how documentation supports their actions.

2. Testing & Jira:
	•	Explored the status and lifecycle of relevant Jira tickets for FS 25.5, especially closed and recently updated ones, to track progress and changes.
	•	Performed end-to-end testing on the UAT platform, covering everything from creating requests to final decision review.
	•	Accessed various environments including Dev, QA, and UAT, and validated request handling across them.
	•	Paid attention to edge cases and user flows to improve confidence in testing.

3. Ongoing Practice & Reviews:
	•	Repeated tasks on the UAT portal to reinforce understanding and avoid errors during future testing.
	•	Revisited workflows, forms, and submission flows to become more efficient in navigating the platform.

4. SQL & Backend Practice:
	•	Focused on refining query-building logic by working on structured data examples and result validation.
	•	Practiced working with tabular data and filtering conditions to support backend testing requirements.
	•	Maintained and updated a shared Excel sheet to track query patterns, examples, and learnings for future reference.
